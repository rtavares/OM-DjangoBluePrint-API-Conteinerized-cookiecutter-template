# Business Requirements for Open Minds - Django Blueprint - CookieCutter template  

## Goal
The goal for this CookieCutter template is to have an easy and straightforward way to quickly spin-up a new Django Project.
So a development Team can focus on the goals of the project that they are developing, instead of re-doing the same initial boilerplate over and over.

It also helps to maintain consistency across new projects, on what it refers to naming conventions, folder structure security  and best practices of the industry.
When things evolve, it would be easy to upgrade the Template, so new projects can start up-to-date.

The Template for Project is structured in a logic of separation between FrontEnc and BackEnd.
Django Rest Framework will be used to serve an API to FrontEnd.

However, still possible to use Django views / templates on the usual monolithic way.

### Note: 
Normally a B.R. should be a closed and signed document before development starts. 
However, once this is kinf of an interactive process, B.R. can be updated along development.
